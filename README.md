### DATA SOURCES
The Primary data used for this dataset was gotteen from [Christian bible word count](https://www.christianbiblereference.org/faq_WordCount.htm) containing informations for major word counts for different versions of the old and new testament. 

### TOOLS
- Excel was the only tool used in this analysis, for the following:
  - Data cleaning.
  - Data Preparation and Transformations.
  - Data Visualization.

### Data cleaning
in the initial phase, the following the task was performed:
- Data loading and inspection.
- Data Cleaning and Formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

The EDA invovled exploring the data to answer key question like:

- what are the most repeated words in the new testament?
- what do they entail about the primary Focus compared to Christians today?
- Are they the major focus of the churches today?

### Data analysis

1. The Data was first extracted from [Christian bible word count](https://www.christianbiblereference.org/faq_WordCount.htm). 
2. Rearranged to be divided overall into old and new testament rather than by individual versions.
3. using conditional formatting and sorting,  the new testament(which is the focus) was then sorted based on most frequent words for each version as a column and then conditional formatted into the best fit.
4. Then using the visualization properties of Microsft Excel, the analyzed data from the new Testament was visualized to expose the level of repetition for every word.

### Results and Findings
For the sake of clarity, Only the first 10 most frequent words were used for the visualization.

1. The visualization reveals God, Jesus, Lord, Christ, Father, Heaven, Faith, Love, Grace and Believe as the overall 10 most frequent words used in the new testament following the order it was written.
2. This also reveals the digression of a significant number of christians from the clear emphasis of the bible in terms of love, faith and believe.

### Recommendations
1. The Concept of the word "Christian" simply entails Christ-like and the digression of believers as emphasized in number 2 of the results and findings reveals a departure from the original focus for which the name was originally given, therefore a personal self analysis is to be done by every believer as to reallign himself or herself with original purpose for which the name was given.

### LIMITATION
1. From a theological standpoint, there is more to this dataset that my understanding may not be able to grasp as of the time of this analysis.
2. The analysis is focused on word emphasis but does not undermine the importance of words and concepts not emphaszied as much by the Bible as they are of equal importance.
3. This is my first time using Github and this is also my first visualization and therefore i am open to your corrections, guidance, mentorship and/or internship opportunities to help me as i move ahead on my data analysis Journey.
